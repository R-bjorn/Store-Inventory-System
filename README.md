Store Inventory System (**SIS**) is a software system for **tracking** _inventory levels, orders, sales_ and *deliveries*. It can also be used in the manufacturing industry to create a work order, bill of materials and other production-related documents.
## About this Project

### Goal :
> Understand the types of testing, and techniques for testing programs written using object-oriented programming and to practice Java code testing using the JUnit framework.

### Objectives
