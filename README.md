# Store Inventory System
> Store Inventory System (**SIS**) is a software system for **tracking** _inventory levels, orders, sales_ and *deliveries*. It can also be used in the manufacturing industry to create a work order, bill of materials and other production-related documents.
## About this Project

### Goal :
> Understand the types of testing, and techniques for testing programs written using object-oriented programming and to practice Java code testing using the JUnit framework.

### Objectives
* Develop a small program for managing inventory and sales for a pretend store.
* Add store products such as **books**, **movies**, **games**, and **CDs**. 
* Design a set of test cases for the system and report the results for testing the code.
